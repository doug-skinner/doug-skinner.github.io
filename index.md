Hello, my name is Doug and I'm glad that you're here on my little slice of the internet. This page, and the whole site, will have more content soon, but for now things are pretty bare bones. But, let me tell you at least a little about myself.

My day job is as a Software Engineer. Specifically, I am currently a Senior Backend Engineer [@Parexel](https://www.parexel.com), a clinical research company. None of the opinions on this site represent my employer, and only represent me.

If you ever need to get in touch, please email me. I'll try to get back to you within a couple of days.
