## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt divided
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 small yellow onion finely chopped
- 3 large cloves garlic minced (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon ground chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne use more if you like the dish spicy
- 1 8-ounce can no salt added tomato sauce
- 1 14.5-ounce can light coconut milk
- ¾ cup frozen peas no need to thaw
- ½ cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
- Prepared brown rice or Homemade Naan; for serving
- Fresh cilantro for serving

## Instructions

1. Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and set aside.
2. In a Dutch oven or similar large, sturdy pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the onion. Cook until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger, garam masala, chili powder, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is completely soft and the spices are very fragrant, about 3 minutes more.
3. Add the chicken pieces, stir to coat with the spices and onion, and cook, stirring often, just until the outsides start to brown, about 4 minutes.
4. Add the tomato sauce, coconut milk, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine.
5. Bring the pot to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low. Let simmer gently until the sauce thickens slightly and the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 20 minutes.
6. Stir in the peas.
7. Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes, and then stir in the Greek yogurt (do not stir in the Greek yogurt right away or it may curdle). Enjoy warm with rice or naan and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.
