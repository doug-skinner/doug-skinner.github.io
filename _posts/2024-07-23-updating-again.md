[Another blog post](https://lars-christian.com/re-do-people-irl-know-you-have-a-blog/) that I came across through it's [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41041537). The author talks about how almost no one in their life knows that they have a blog, nor would care. Putting aside the way that the author seems to degrade his wife in the story, it is interesting. While there is almost no content on this site, I do sometimes wonder what would happen if I put it out there and peope started reading it once there is more content on here.

Opinions in the HN thread seem to say that unless you are using the blog to get a job, then it shouldn't say anything about your work. I'm not too sure about that. We'll see what I wind up doing. At least the above post was the trigger to update this site for the first time in months, with links to a few more recipes that we make.
