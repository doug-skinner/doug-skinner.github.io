Other than a bad paraphrase of a Red-vs-Blue quote, I thought it would be worthwhile to pinpoint in this directory why I am trying to write things down.

I have a strong tendency to want to mess with systems, but don't necessarily like using the systems after I have made them. I have spent time over the last few years getting really into org mode, Getting Things Done, the Reminders app, markdown files, bullet journaling, other paper written journaling, etc and always just find myself spinning my wheels. I don't ever get the benefit of making the systems, because I am never in them long enough to properly extract it. By the time I re-research the system (because let's be honest, i've tried them all before) and then implement it, I'm out of time and have to get back to executing. But I get lost in that, and never properly use the system. Well, enough is enough. No more systems. No more getting lost trying to figure out what system I need or how to use it. Instead I just need to write down more things in these files and go from there.

Hopefully this will be enough.
