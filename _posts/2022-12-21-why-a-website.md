I've been thinking about this on and off over the past few years. I've had a website before, but it was a static site hosted on GitHub pages like this one. I didn't really do anything with it, and it was just a place to put my resume and a few other things. I've also had a blog on Medium, but I didn't really do anything with that either. I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while, but I've never really had a good reason to do it. I've been thinking about it again recently, and I think I've finally figured out why I want to do it.

I have an innate desire to write things. I can't explain it, but it's there. I've always wanted to be a writer, and at the end of 2022 I decided there is no better time than now to start. So that's what this is. On this website I will write anything and everything that strikes my fancy, even if it doesn't make too much sense or is weird. I'm not going to worry about it too much. I'm going to write about whatever I want, and I'm going to write it for me. I'm not going to worry about what other people think. I'm not going to worry about whether or not it's good. I'm just going to write.

Going along with this, the ideal audience of this website is... me. I hope that if others find this website they enjoy it, but I'll primarily be writing this for me.
