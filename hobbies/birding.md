## Birds I've Seen

A list of birds I've seen in the wild. Calling out the ones I've seen in my backyard, because that's just fun information to have. Both lists are in the order I saw them, roughly. The first ~60 in the list are not in order, because I didn't start keeping track until I was in my 20s, but I know I saw them before that.
