title: "Touch ID As Security key for Github"
---

After work required MFA to keep using our Github accounts, I found a cool blog post about using [your MacBook's Touch ID as a Security Key for Github](https://www.stevemar.net/touch-id-as-a-security-key/). Posting for future reference. **Caution**: this only works on a macbook when using the Safari browser, does not work with Arc and the like.
